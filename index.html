   <p id="bio"> My Favourite book series is really hard to chose, as I love reading so much, but I think I would chose the Heroes of Olympus series by Rick Riordan. The story is about 7 American demigods (half god-half human) as they travel from America to Greece to stop the evil earth mother, Gaia, from awakening and destroying the world. For a bigger description, go to plot. I really love these books as it is full of humor, fantasy and action. I found out about this series when my friend reccommended Rick Riordan's first series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians. It was amazing and I loved it so much that it inspired me to read most of Rick Riordans books, including this series. Rick Riordan is one of my favourite writers, and i plan to read every one of his books! As these books are based of lots of Greek Mythology, I have a extensive knowledge of it. To finish I would like to say that these books have been so brilliant that it has spurred me on to write my own book! </p>

    <section id="plot"> 
    <p> The plot of the whole series is quite a rollercoster ride, so I will explain book by book.
        The Lost Hero is the first bok in the series and it starts with Jason, a sixteen year old American kid, waking up on a bus with no memories at all. He finds that he is sitting next to his apparant girlfriend Piper McLean and his best friend Leo Valdez. When the bus they are on reaches their destination, the Grand Canyon, they are attacked by greek storm spirits, Ánemoi Thúellai. They successfully defeat the spirits and are picked up by a team of demigods (the offspring of gods and mortals) to take them to Camp Half Blood (Camp Half Blood is a camp for greek demigods) Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena, goddess of wisdom and Butch, son of Iris, goddess of rainbows. When they reach, they find that another demigod, Percy Jackson, Annabeth's boyfriend, has gone missing. Piper and Leo are claimed by their godly parents, Aphrodite, goddess of love for Piper and Hephaestus god of blacksmiths for Leo. Jason find out that he has been claimed before, but since he lost his memories he can't remember who his godly parent is. Later, at the campfire, Jason summons lightning, making it obvious who his godly parent is, Zeus, god of the skies. They hear of the 'prophecy of 7' which is a prophecy about 7 demigods who have to complete a quest to defeat an elusive villain. It is obvious that Jason Piper and Leo are 3 of the 7 that have been mentioned in the prophecy. There is another prophecy said then and the trio is then sent on a quest to free Hera, goddess of marraige and family from her cage. Jason's memories start to come back throughout the quest, until they are fully restored. He remembers that he is the son of the Roman equivalent of Zeus, Jupiter and remembers where the camp for Roman demigods is...
        <br>
        <br>
        The Son of Neptune is the second book and is about Percy Jackson, the missing demigod from Camp Half Blood. He has lost all his memeories, except for one name, Annabeth. He stumbles onto the Camp for Roman demigods, Camp Jupiter. He is introduced by Juno, Roman equivalent of Hera, as the son of Neptune (Roman equivalent of Posieden, god of the seas). He gets a tour of Camp Jupiter, by Frank Zhang, son of Mars (equivalent of Ares, god of war). Later, he is offered a quest to free Thanatos, god of death. He choses Frank and Hazel Levesque, daughter of Pluto (equivalent of Hades, god of the underowrld), as his companions for the quest. His memories start to come back and he remembers everything. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Mark of Athena is the third book and starts out with Annabeth on the prophecy of 7's ship(she is part of the 7 too) looking for her boyfriend Percy Jackson, who is a part as well. They know where he is; at the Roman Camp and her, Jason, Piper and Leo are on board. They then find him, with his two new friends,  Hazel and Frank. The 7 demigods of the prophecy have been found. Hazel, Jason, Piper, Leo, Frank, Percy and Annabeth. They leave the Roman Camp in a hurry, when they find that someone accidently fired cannons on the camp. The Romans then follow, not so far behind. The main plot follows Annabeth as she tries to find the Athena Parthenos, a huge statue of her mother which could bring peace to the Roman Camp, who are attacking Camp Half-Blood. The 7 find themselves in Rome then, trying to rescue Nico Di Angelo, who has been kidnapped. Annabeth leaves to find her mother's statue. An annoying cliffhanger, courtesy of Rick Riordan.
        <br>
        <br>
        The House of Hades is the fourth book in which the rest of the 7+Nico scramble to get to Greece, find the Doors of Death and close them, and to also find Percy and Annabeth, who will close the doors from the other side as well. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Blood of Olympus is the last book in the series, in which the 7 have to finally defaet Gaea, Mother Earth, who is awakening. Nico di Angelo and Reyna Avila Ramirez-Arellano have to hurry to get the Athena Parthenos to Camp Half-Blood and bring peace to Camp Jupiter and Camp Half-Blood. There is a big twist at the end and a HUGE cliffhanger (again)... Thanks Rick.
